Or alternatively, you can create your own client library, following the [implementation documentation](api/index.md).
Any client libraries marked with `Unmaintained` have been marked as such as their repositories have not received any commits for at least 1 year since time of checking,
however they are listed as they may still support Lavalink, and/or have not needed maintenance, however keep in mind that compatibility and full feature support is not guaranteed.
