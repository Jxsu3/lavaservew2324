# Getting Started

Welcome to the Lavalink Getting Started guide. If you're new to Lavalink, follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Java 17 or higher. You can download it [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu).
2. Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases/latest).
3. Check out the [configuration](../configuration/index.md) page to learn how to configure Lavalink.
4. Run Lavalink with `java -jar Lavalink.jar`.

Now you can connect to Lavalink with your client. You can find a list of clients [here](../clients.md).

If you want to run the Lavalink server without it closing when you close the terminal, you can see the [Docker](../configuration/docker.md) or [Systemd](../configuration/systemd.md) configuration pages.
